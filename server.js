// EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node.js. The template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into the HTML template at the client-side and produce the final HTML.It's like DTL(Django Template Language) in Django to access the server side data in front end. This also works similar way!!


// Passport is the authentication middleware for Node. It is designed to serve a singular purpose which is to authenticate requests. It is not practical to store user password as the original string in the database but it is a good practice to hash the password and then store them into the database. But with passport-local-mongoose you donâ€™t have to hash the password using the crypto module, passport-local-mongoose will do everything for you. If you use passport-local-mongoose this module will auto-generate salt and hash fields in the DB. You will not have a field for the password, instead, you will have salt and hash.

// Passport is very easy to integrate NodeJs package, which is used for adding authentication features to our website or web app.This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications. By plugging into Passport, local authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.

// "passport-local" i.e. the local version of passport that essentially allows us to use usernames and passwords for loggin in. passport has a bunch of different ways we can log in whether it's through Google,Facebook,local password,email,etc.


// In order to store and persist our user across different pages, we need to use express-session. For session to use, first we have to install it.And to display messages for if we fail to login we install and use "express-flash" which is used by passport inside internals to display those nice handy messages for wrong emails,wrong password,etc.

What is allows to do is actually override method that we were using and so instead of using post, we can actually call this delete method here.
